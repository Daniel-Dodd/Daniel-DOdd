### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year PhD student at the [STOR-i centre for doctoral training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/). I'm broadly interested in experimental design with Bayesian nonparametrics, though I've currently fallen down the rabbit hole of Gaussian processes. Checkout out my website for more info: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i-student-sites/daniel-dodd.
